From 2022 to 2025, I worked at <a href="https://monk.ai/">Monk AI</a> (acquired by <a href="https://www.acvauctions.com/">ACV Auctions</a>), as a machine learning lead to deliver automatic vehicle inspection service (performance up 90%). I also created client-oriented LLM and RankSys applications to give better system performance.

Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.unissey.com/en">Unissey</a>, a French startup, focused on facial biometrics solution for seamless remote identity verification. 

At early stage of my professional career, I worked at <a href="https://www.flyinstinct.com/">Flyinstinct</a> and led a team to deliver airport security related digital platform, including computer vision based runway inspection service and data management service.

Obtained my Ph.D. in <strong>Robotic and AI</strong> from the Sorbonne Universit√© (supervised by Prof. <a href="http://www.isir.upmc.fr/?op=view_profil&lang=fr&id=7" target="_blank">Catherine ACHARD</a>) at the laboratory <a href="http://www.isir.upmc.fr/">ISIR</a>. My research focuses on applying <strong>computer vision and machine learning</strong> on social science research to understand the human-human interaction. Social interaction features are firstly extracted with the techniques of computer vision and speech processing. Then, machine learning models are used to <strong>analyse</strong> the features, <strong>prove</strong> our hypotheses, and <strong>interpret</strong> the social interaction.<br/>

Before my Ph.D., I got my first MSc of Computer vision and machine learning from Zhejiang University, China and the second MSc of Computer science and network from Telecom-Paris, France. <br/>

I just start to write a tech blog to record my study and work on AI and to share with others. The posts are mainly about computer vision and machine learning as well as the algorithm. If you have some suggestions about the blog or want to see some other interesting topics about AI, please email me.
